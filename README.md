# Managing-library-data-using-Java-collections


*Project Description (for Resume):*

I have developed a Java-based Library Management System, which is a robust and user-friendly application for managing a library's book inventory. This project showcases my proficiency in Java programming and software development skills.

*Key Features:*

- *Book Class:* I created a `Book` class to represent books in the library. Each book has attributes such as title, author, unique book ID, and availability status.

- *Library Class:* The `Library` class manages a collection of books using an ArrayList. It offers functionalities to add books, display the entire book collection, find books by ID, borrow books, and return books.

- *User Interaction:* The system interacts with users through a command-line interface. It presents a menu where users can choose to display all books, borrow a book by ID, return a book by ID, or exit the system.

- *Availability Tracking:* The system keeps track of book availability, ensuring that books are only borrowed when they are available and returned correctly.

- *Scalable:* The project is designed to handle a growing library collection by using dynamic data structures.

This Library Management System demonstrates my ability to design and implement object-oriented software, handle user input and interaction, and manage data effectively. Its clean code structure and user-friendly interface make it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
